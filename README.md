👋 Hello! I'm Gassem, a passionate frontend developer based in the vibrant city of Tetouan, Morocco. With a keen eye for design and a love for coding, I specialize in creating seamless, user-friendly web interfaces that engage and delight.

🌐 My journey in web development started with a fascination for how websites are built. This curiosity quickly grew into a career, where I now excel in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular frameworks like React and Vue.js. I am constantly exploring new technologies to stay at the forefront of web design trends.
